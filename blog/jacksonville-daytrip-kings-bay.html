        <p class="post-subtitle">One of the benefits of living and working in Camden County is how easy it is to explore nearby spots without a long drive.</p>
      </header>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>This past weekend, we took a short day trip down to Jacksonville—less than an hour from Kings Bay. It's one of those simple reminders of why living in Camden County offers the best of both worlds: small-town feel with big-city access just down the road.</p>

        <h2>Tillie K. Fowler Regional Park: A Peaceful Reset Near NAS Jacksonville</h2>

        <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
          <img src="../images/Tillie Fowler Park Jacksonville.jpg" alt="Tillie K. Fowler Regional Park trails and nature near NAS Jacksonville" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--gray); margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Historic trails wind through 509 acres of natural Florida landscape</p>
        </div>

        <p>We spent most of our time at <a href="#" onclick="return showExternalLinkDisclaimer('https://www.jacksonville.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/recreation-and-community-programming/specialty-parks-main/tillie-k-fowler-regional-park-and-nature-center');">Tillie K. Fowler Regional Park</a>, one of Jacksonville's largest city parks at 509 acres. Located on the Westside near NAS Jacksonville, it's a peaceful reset—perfect for military families looking to decompress after a busy week.</p>

        <h3>History Meets Nature</h3>

        <p>The park has a fascinating military connection. During World War I, this area was part of Camp Johnston, an Army training camp that spread across 160 acres with over 600 buildings and the nation's second-largest rifle range. Today, the park sits across from Naval Air Station Jacksonville, connecting its military heritage to its present role as community green space.</p>

        <p>The park is named after the late City Council President and U.S. Representative Tillie Fowler, who championed its development in the 1990s. In 1996, the observation tower, nature center, and outdoor classroom were dedicated.</p>

        <h3>The Trails & That View</h3>

        <p>We walked the trails, visited the nature center, and took in the historic brick paths throughout the park. Those brick roads are remnants of a 16-foot wide road constructed to allow travel through the swampland, once linking the Ortega peninsula to Jacksonville.</p>

        <p><strong>Do yourself a favor and walk the trail to the observation tower.</strong> The Tower Trail is about 1.2 miles round trip from the nature center. The 50-foot wood platform rises out of the ground and into the trees, providing views of the marsh and Ortega River. The view is totally worth it—a peaceful overlook where you can spot wildlife in the marsh below.</p>

        <h2>Chamblin Bookmine: A Literary Landmark</h2>

        <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
          <img src="../images/Chamblin_Bookmine.jpg" alt="Chamblin Bookmine independent bookstore Jacksonville Florida" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--gray); margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">23,000 square feet of books across two buildings</p>
        </div>

        <p>On the way down, we stopped by <a href="#" onclick="return showExternalLinkDisclaimer('https://www.chamblinbookmine.com/');">Chamblin Bookmine</a> to drop off some trade-ins. After the park, we went back to wander the maze of shelves and leave with a solid book haul.</p>

        <p>This place is the largest bookstore in Jacksonville—23,000 square feet across two buildings at 4551 Roosevelt Blvd. If you're into graphic novels, trade paperbacks, or comic art books, they have a massive collection. We've been coming here as a family for years. They also have a huge selection of children's books at great prices, and their trade-in program means you can refresh your bookshelf without breaking the bank.</p>

        <h2>European Street: Riverside Charm</h2>

          <img src="../images/European Street Jacksonville.jpg" alt="European Street Riverside Jacksonville dining and shops" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--gray); margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">European Street in the heart of Riverside—perfect for a leisurely walk after lunch</p>
        </div>

        <p>From there, we made our way to European Street off Park for lunch. It's in the heart of Riverside, a perfect place for a leisurely walk after lunch. The area has that walkable, neighborhood vibe with local shops, cafes, and restaurants—exactly what you want after spending the morning in nature.</p>

        <p>We wrapped things up with a coffee stop at <a href="#" onclick="return showExternalLinkDisclaimer('https://www.boldbeancoffee.com/');">Bold Bean on Stockton</a>. Simple plans, close to home, and a great reminder of how much there is to enjoy just down the road when you live and work locally.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters for Kings Bay Families</h2>

        <p>If you're PCSing to Kings Bay or house hunting in Camden County, one of the questions you might have is: <em>What is there to do outside of the base?</em></p>

        <p>The answer: plenty. Less than an hour north, Jacksonville offers culture, nature, dining, and entertainment. You get the benefits of living in a quieter, more affordable area (Camden County) while having easy access to everything a major city offers.</p>

        <p>Whether you're exploring trails with kids, hunting for books, or finding your favorite coffee spot, these are the kinds of experiences that make a place feel like home—not just a duty station.</p>
