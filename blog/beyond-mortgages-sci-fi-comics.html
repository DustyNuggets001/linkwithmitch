  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content-box">
        <p class="lead">If you've ever been in my office or followed me on social media, you've probably noticed something: I'm a bit of a geek. My desk and shelves are full of Funko Pops, model kits, comic book art, and collectibles from some of my favorite sci-fi and superhero franchises.</p>

        <p>It might seem odd for a mortgage loan officer to have Optimus Prime standing next to his laptop, or an X-Files print hanging on the wall. But for me, these aren't just decorations—they're reminders of why I do what I do, and how staying curious and creative makes me better at serving my clients.</p>

        <p>So here's the story behind my sci-fi and comics obsession, and why I think it actually makes me a better lender.</p>

  <!-- The Collection -->
  <section class="content-section bg-light">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">What's on My Shelf?</h2>
      <div class="content-box">
        <p class="lead">My office is a mix of nostalgia, fandom, and things that just make me smile. Here's what you'll find:</p>

        <div class="features-grid" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>The X-Files</h3>
            <p>I've been a fan since the show first aired in the '90s. I have an X-Files print on my wall—a reminder that asking questions, investigating details, and not taking things at face value is essential in any profession. "The truth is out there" applies to mortgages too (even if it's buried in a closing disclosure).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Optimus Prime & Transformers</h3>
            <p>Transformers were my gateway into science fiction as a kid. The idea of robots that could transform, adapt, and protect resonated with me. I keep an Optimus Prime figure on my desk—a reminder to be flexible, adapt to challenges, and always lead with integrity.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Godzilla</h3>
            <p>There's something deeply satisfying about giant monster movies. Godzilla represents resilience, power, and the ability to rise above impossible odds. Plus, the films are just fun. I've got a few Godzilla figures and posters that remind me not to take life too seriously.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Superman & DC Comics</h3>
            <p>Superman has always been my favorite superhero—not because of the powers, but because of the values. He's about hope, helping people, and doing the right thing even when it's hard. That's the kind of approach I try to bring to every client interaction.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Macross Models</h3>
            <p>Macross (Robotech for us '80s kids) combines mecha, music, and epic storytelling. I enjoy building model kits as a way to unwind and focus on something creative. There's a lot of patience and precision involved—skills that translate directly to mortgage processing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>Funko Pops & More</h3>
            <p>My collection includes characters from Star Wars, Marvel, DC, anime, and classic movies. They're conversation starters, they make my office feel welcoming, and they remind me to stay connected to the things I loved as a kid.</p>

  <!-- Why It Matters -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Why Comics & Sci-Fi Make Me a Better Loan Officer</h2>
      <div class="content-box">
        <p class="lead">You might be wondering: What does any of this have to do with mortgages? Actually, a lot.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--navy);">1. Curiosity Fuels Problem-Solving</h3>
        <p>Science fiction is all about asking "what if?" and exploring possibilities. That same curiosity helps me find creative solutions for my clients—whether it's exploring down payment assistance programs, using second-tier VA entitlement, or structuring a refinance to save money.</p>
        <p>Every client's situation is different, and I approach each one with the same sense of discovery I bring to a new comic series or sci-fi novel.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--navy);">2. Stories Matter</h3>
        <p>Comics and sci-fi are fundamentally about storytelling—understanding characters, motivations, and journeys. In mortgage lending, every client has a story. Maybe it's a military family PCSing across the country, a first-time buyer overcoming credit challenges, or a veteran using their VA benefit for the first time.</p>
        <p>Listening to those stories, understanding goals, and helping clients navigate their journey is what I do best. The skills I've learned from decades of reading and watching stories translate directly into better client relationships.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--navy);">3. Optimism and Hope</h3>
        <p>Even in the darkest sci-fi or superhero stories, there's almost always a theme of hope—that good can triumph, that problems can be solved, that heroes rise to meet challenges. That optimism is essential in mortgage lending, where clients are often stressed, uncertain, or worried about whether homeownership is even possible.</p>
        <p>I genuinely believe that for every challenge, there's a path forward. Whether that's improving credit, finding the right loan program, or timing a PCS move perfectly—there's always a solution. And if Superman can save the world, we can figure out your VA entitlement calculation.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--navy);">4. Attention to Detail</h3>
        <p>Building model kits, reading intricate storylines, and following complex sci-fi plots all require patience and attention to detail. The same is true for mortgages. One missed document, one miscalculated ratio, or one overlooked program can make the difference between approval and denial.</p>
        <p>My hobbies keep me sharp, focused, and detail-oriented—all skills that directly benefit my clients.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--navy);">5. It Keeps Me Grounded</h3>
        <p>Let's be honest: mortgage lending can be stressful. Tight deadlines, compliance rules, underwriting challenges—it's easy to burn out. My sci-fi and comics collection reminds me to step back, have fun, and remember that life is about more than just work.</p>
        <p>When I take a break to build a Macross model or watch a Godzilla movie, I come back to my desk refreshed, recharged, and ready to serve my clients better.</p>

  <!-- Personal Touch -->
  <section class="content-section bg-light">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">What This Means for You</h2>
      <div class="content-box">
        <p class="lead">If you work with me, you're not just getting a loan officer who knows VA loans and down payment assistance programs. You're getting someone who genuinely cares about your story, stays curious about finding the best solutions, and approaches every challenge with optimism and creativity.</p>

        <p>You're also getting someone who won't judge you for your hobbies, interests, or passions—because I've got a shelf full of action figures and comic books, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

        <p>Whether you're a fellow geek, a military family trying to navigate a PCS, or just someone looking for a lender who actually listens—I'm here to help. And if you want to talk about Transformers, Godzilla, or whether Superman could beat Goku in a fight while we're reviewing your loan options, I'm all in.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Let's Connect</h3>
          <p>If you're on Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn, follow me to see updates on new collectibles, model builds, and yes—mortgage tips too. I post regularly about both my professional work and my personal interests, because I believe authenticity matters.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">And if you're ever in my office in Brunswick, Georgia, feel free to check out the shelf and ask me about any of the figures. I've got stories for every single one.</p>

  <!-- Closing Thought -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content-box">
        <h2 style="color: var(--navy);">Final Thought</h2>
        <p class="lead">I love what I do—helping people achieve homeownership, navigate VA benefits, and build financial security. But I also love sci-fi, comics, robots, monsters, and superheroes.</p>

        <p>Those two things aren't separate. They're part of who I am, and they make me better at serving you.</p>

        <p>So whether you're planning a PCS to Kings Bay, exploring down payment assistance, or just need someone to walk you through the VA loan process with patience and clarity—let's talk. And if you want to geek out about comics along the way, even better.</p>
