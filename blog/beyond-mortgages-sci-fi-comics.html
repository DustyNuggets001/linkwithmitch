        <p class="lead">If you've ever been in my office or seen photos of my workspace, you've probably noticed something right away. It doesn't look like a traditional bank office. There are comic books, sci-fi collectibles, model kits, and more than a few figures on the shelves. Optimus Prime has been known to stand guard near my desk, and an X-Files print hangs nearby.</p>

        <p>For a mortgage loan officer, that might seem a little out of place. But for me, it's intentional.</p>

        <p>Those things aren't just decorations. They're reminders of how I think, how I work, and why I approach my job the way I do.</p>

        <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
          <img src="../images/office-heroes-shelf.jpg" alt="Mitch Blyler's office shelf with superhero collectibles and figures" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--gray); margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">My office shelf - where Superman, Optimus Prime, and the gang keep me company</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Curiosity Matters</h2>
        <p>I've been a fan of science fiction and comics for as long as I can remember. Stories like The X-Files stuck with me not just because they were entertaining, but because they were about asking questions. Digging deeper. Not taking the first answer at face value.</p>

        <p>That mindset carries directly into my work. Mortgage lending is full of assumptions and half-truths. I spend a lot of time helping clients unlearn things they've been "confidently wrong" about and walking through what actually applies to their situation. Curiosity is what leads to better questions, and better questions lead to better solutions.</p>

        <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
          <img src="../images/truth-is-out-there.jpg" alt="The X-Files The Truth is Out There print in Mitch's office" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--gray); margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">"The Truth is Out There" - even in closing disclosures</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Adaptability Is Everything</h2>
        <p>Transformers were my gateway into science fiction as a kid, and Optimus Prime is still one of my favorite characters. The idea of adapting to challenges while leading with integrity stuck with me.</p>

        <p>Every loan file is different. Guidelines change, timelines shift, and real life doesn't always cooperate. Being flexible, calm, and willing to adjust the plan without losing sight of the goal is a big part of what makes the process smoother for clients. That reminder sits right on my desk.</p>

        <h2>Doing the Right Thing Still Matters</h2>
        <p>Superman has always been my favorite superhero, not because of the powers, but because of the values. He represents doing the right thing even when it's difficult or inconvenient.</p>

        <p>That's something I take seriously in my work. My job isn't to force a loan to fit or to rush someone into a decision. It's to give clear information, set realistic expectations, and help clients make choices that actually serve them, not just today but down the road.</p>

        <h2>Details Make or Break the Outcome</h2>
        <p>Building model kits and following complex sci-fi storylines requires patience and attention to detail. Mortgages are no different. One missed document or overlooked guideline can derail an otherwise solid transaction.</p>

        <p>Those hobbies keep me sharp. They reinforce the importance of slowing down, double-checking the details, and staying focused until the job is done right.</p>

        <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
          <img src="../images/funko-pops.jpg" alt="Collection of Funko Pop figures in Mitch's office" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--gray); margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">Just a small portion of the Funko collection - conversation starters and reminders to stay grounded</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Staying Grounded Matters Too</h2>
        <p>Mortgage lending can be stressful. Deadlines are real, compliance is real, and clients are often making one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. Burnout helps no one.</p>

        <p>My office reminds me to step back, keep perspective, and not take myself too seriously. When I recharge, I show up better for my clients. Calm, clear, and ready to solve problems instead of creating them.</p>

        <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
        <p>If you work with me, you're not just getting someone who understands VA loans, PCS moves, and down payment assistance. You're getting someone who listens, stays curious, and approaches challenges with patience and creativity.</p>

        <p>You're also getting someone who believes authenticity matters. I won't judge your interests, your background, or where you're starting from. I've got a shelf full of action figures and comic books. I'm not here to judge anyone.</p>

        <h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <p class="lead">I love what I do. Helping people navigate homeownership, understand their options, and feel confident in the process is genuinely rewarding work. I also love science fiction, comics, robots, monsters, and superheroes.</p>

        <p>Those things aren't separate. They're part of who I am, and they shape how I show up for my clients.</p>

        <p>So if you're looking for a lender who takes the work seriously but doesn't lose the human side of it, we'll probably get along just fine. And if you want to talk Transformers, Godzilla, or whether Batman could really take Superman while we're reviewing numbers, I'm always up for that too.</p>
