This includes statewide options like Georgia Dream, national programs through FHLBank (FHLB), and additional resources available through our lender partnerships. For eligible buyers in Camden County and surrounding areas, many locations also qualify for USDA financing, which can offer a 0% down payment option depending on income limits and property location. I review your goals and eligibility to help match you with the programs or loan structures that best fit your situation."

This is common during PCS moves when selling the previous home isn't practical or desirable.

Your entitlement may be fully restored after selling a home with a VA loan and paying off the loan in full, and in some cases you may even be able to use remaining entitlement to purchase again without selling your previous property. I help buyers understand how VA entitlement works, how restoration applies, and how to plan future purchases as duty stations or life circumstances change."

I have extensive experience helping service members and veterans use the VA IRRRL (Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan), the VA's streamlined refinance option for existing VA mortgages. An IRRRL can simplify the process of updating your current VA loan by reducing documentation, speeding up timelines, and making the refinance more straightforward than a traditional refinance.

Whether this is appropriate depends on your situation, future plans, and current VA guidelines."

            <p>I lend in all 50 states, but my local focus is helping buyers and homeowners in Camden County, Kingsland, St. Marys, Woodbine, Brunswick, and the surrounding North Florida and South Georgia communities.</p>
            <p>I live and work here, and I reinvest in our community through organizations like Rotary and the local Chamber of Commerce. Whether you're purchasing locally or relocating from out of state, I provide guidance tailored to your goals and the market you're moving into.</p>

            <h3>How long does a mortgage pre-qualification take?</h3>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Most pre-qualifications can be completed the same day once I have the required information, depending on volume and completeness. I pride myself on speed and communication, and my systems allow me to review applications and issue pre-qualification letters quickly, even when I'm away from my desk.</p>
            <p>Whether I'm in the office or on the go, I make sure you get timely updates and a clear understanding of your numbers.</p>

            <h3>Are you licensed to lend in multiple states?</h3>
            <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. I am licensed to lend in all 50 states, and I actively help buyers close loans across the country—not just in Georgia. Many of my clients are military families completing PCS moves, so I regularly assist with transactions in other states such as Florida, Virginia, Connecticut, California, Texas, and more.</p>
            <p>While my local focus is Camden County and the surrounding North Florida/South Georgia area, I can support you wherever your move takes you.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. I work with first-time homebuyers every day, including many service members using the VA loan program for the first time. I guide buyers through the full process—explaining how to use VA benefits now and how those benefits can support future home purchases as your career or duty stations change.</p>
            <p>I also help explore grant and down payment assistance options, review credit improvement strategies, and make sure you understand each step clearly. My goal is to help you feel confident and well-informed as you purchase your first home.</p>

        <!-- FAQ Item 18 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h3>Can I rent out my home if I bought it with a VA loan?</h3>
            <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>VA loans are intended for primary residences, so at the time you purchase with a VA loan, you must certify that you intend to occupy the property as your primary home. However, life and duty stations can change.</p>
            <p>After you have met the occupancy requirement, many borrowers do later move and convert a VA-financed property to a rental. Whether this is appropriate depends on your situation, future plans, and current VA guidelines. I can't provide legal or tax advice, but I can help explain how the VA side typically looks and recommend that you consult with appropriate professionals before making a decision.</p>
