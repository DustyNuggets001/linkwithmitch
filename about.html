      <h2 class="section-title">My Story</h2>
      <div class="bio-content">
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Mitch Blyler</strong>, a Mortgage Loan Officer with <strong>Presidential Bank Mortgage</strong> and a licensed lender in all 50 states (<strong>NMLS 2074110</strong>). I help service members, veterans, first-time buyers, and experienced homeowners navigate the mortgage process with clarity, confidence, and consistent communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is simple: provide personalized service, trustworthy guidance, and a smooth, stress-reduced mortgage experience. I combine the personal touch of a local banker with access to a broad range of loan programs, similar to what you'd expect from a broker. That means you get one committed point of contact helping you explore options across multiple programs and scenarios, rather than being limited to a single "one-size-fits-all" solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have over 20 years of experience working with clients across a wide range of credit backgrounds and financial situations. Whether you're just starting to think about homeownership, actively making an offer, or planning a PCS move across the country, I meet you where you are. We'll begin by discussing your goals, design a realistic plan to help you achieve them, and then walk through each step of the loan process together. My commitment is that you understand your options, know what to expect, and never feel like you're navigating the process alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in VA loans, PCS relocation, and military homebuying, supporting service members at bases such as Kings Bay, NAS Jacksonville, Mayport, and duty stations nationwide. I routinely assist with VA purchases, second-tier entitlement scenarios, VA Jumbo loans, and VA IRRRL streamlined refinances. I also work extensively with FHA, conventional, USDA (including 100% financing in much of Camden County), jumbo, and a variety of down payment assistance programs for both first-time and repeat buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Home financing is more than just numbers on a page. For many of my clients, it's about stability, building long-term wealth, and making smart decisions during important life transitions like a PCS move, a growing family, or a new job opportunity. That's why I put such a strong emphasis on education and communication—ensuring you understand the "why" behind the numbers, not just the "what."
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of lending, I actively invest in the community through organizations such as the <strong>Rotary Club of Camden County</strong> and the <strong>Camden County Chamber of Commerce</strong>. These connections allow me not only to serve as a lender, but also as a local resource—helping military families plug into the community, connecting spouses with employment opportunities, and supporting local small businesses and nonprofits. I believe in servant leadership, long-term relationships, and doing the right thing for the people I serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're buying your first home, refinancing, relocating with a PCS order, or exploring how your home can help you reach long-term financial goals, my team and I are here to guide you. My goal is to be your <strong>lender for life</strong>, someone you can trust to help you buy, refinance, and relocate—anywhere in the United States.
